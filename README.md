GAME: 

A game card deck has four suits:
● Spades: ♠
● Clubs: ♣
● Hearts: ♥
● Diamonds: ♦
Each suit has 13 cards: A (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King). Therefore the deck has 52 cards.
In the game one of the players is the dealer - the dealer shuffles the cards and asks the other player to cut them. Cutting cards is done by splitting the deck into two parts, and placing the bottom part on the top part.
Now that the cards are ready, the dealer starts dealing the cards: one to the player, one to self, until each has four cards. Then, the dealer places four cards on the board. These cards are stacked - that is, they are not side by side, but placed on top of each other.
The game is played by taking turns. The player starts the game and is expected to place one of his cards on top of the board. While doing so, he is allowed to take all the cards from the board if the cards have the same value. If the top card is ♣7 and the player has a 7 from any suit, then the player can play the 7, and take all the cards.
The name “pişti” comes from a case where there is a single card on the board, and one of the players has the same card. For example, there is a single card, ♥4 on the board, and one of the players has a four from any suit, then the player can make a “pişti” and score 10 points.
Talking about “points,” two cards have additional points: ♦10 is 3 points and ♣2 is 2 points. All other cards are 1 point each. Once all cards are played, the player who has more cards gets an additional 3 points.
The “Jack” of any suit has a special power. This card can take all the cards from the board without taking the value of the top card into account.
If there are cards left on the board once all the cards are played, the last player who got the cards from the board also gets the remaining ones.
Basically, the game is to get all the cards on the board either by using a Jack or by using a card that has the same value as the top card on the board.
